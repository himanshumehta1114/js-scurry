## Motivation

Whenever I had to test some npm package, I used to create a directory, run `npm init` and write code. But it was hard to maintain these scripts for me. So I built a vscode extension which exports some commands to take care of above problem.

## Features

- Create playground
- Open playground
- Remove playground

## Install

1. Open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Press `Ctrl+P` to open the Quick Open dialog
3. Type `ext install js-playground` to find the extension
4. Click the `Install` button, then the Enable button

OR

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open the Extensions tab
2. Type `js-playground` to find the extension
3. Click the Install button, then the Enable button

OR

1. Open a command-line prompt
2. Run `code --install-extension himanshumehta1114.vscode-js-playground`
